LinkX was built with patients, providers, and pharmacies in mind. We are a team of pharmacists who envision increased medication transparency and access for everyone. \r\n\r\n**Why we exist**\r\n\r\nWhen a patient discovers a prescription is not covered, is too costly, or is not in stock, options are limited in finding the best choice. Insurance coverage does not cover every medication fully and this means that you are left paying out of pocket or paying high deductibles. Whether you are in your coverage gap or need a specialty medication, we want to increase the ease of finding the best pharmacy to fit your needs.  \r\n\r\nIf it is a prescription from your doctor or your pet’s veterinarian, LinkX is the tool you can use to check cash pricing and medication availability at your local pharmacies all through the click of a button.\r\n\r\n**What do we provide**\r\n\r\n_Extensive pricing_ – Our large medication database allows you to search for your prescription drugs and find the ideal pricing at the pharmacy of your choice. All of the cash prices are transparent and reported from the pharmacy directly. There are no hidden fees or tricks.  \r\n\r\n_Drug availability_ – There is no longer a need of calling or driving from one pharmacy to another hoping to find the medications you need. Our stock indicator helps you quickly and easily find the drugs you need, saving you time and providing you with the peace of mind to keep you and your loved ones healthy. \r\n\r\n_Specialty/compound medication requests_ – In the recent years, there have been an increase in prescriptions for specialty and compounded medications. “Specialty” and compounded medications can be fertility treatments or dermatology creams. Since there are a limited number of compounding and specialty pharmacies, we are here to help you find them.   \r\n\r\n_Reserve your drugs_ – Our reservation feature ensures that your drug needs are taken care of. You select the pharmacy of your choice and you can rest easy knowing your medication will be ready to fill when you bring your hard copy and confirmation number to the pharmacy within a 24-hour period.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
